(It \nmay be there but is probably buried under a million packages so I could not \nfind it.)\n\n## What it does?\n1.  Find this C symbol:                         ✓\n2.  Find this global definition:                ✓\n3.  Find functions called by this function:     ✓\n4.  Find functions calling this function:       ✓\n5.  Find this text string:                      ✓\n6.  Change this text string:                    ✗\n7.  Find this egrep pattern:                    ✓\n8.  Find this file:                             ✓\n9.  Find files #including this file:            ✓\n10. Find assignments to this symbol:            ✓\n\nFinds the selected text or word under cursor to perform a cscope lookup and \ndisplays the results in a panel which shows up above (Check screenshot).\nOr you could just toggle the display of the atom-cscope panel and look it up \nyourself. \n\nThe following commands are registered to execute search with the word in \nselection or under cursor:\n```\natom-cscope:find-symbol\natom-cscope:find-global-definition\natom-cscope:find-functions-called-by\natom-cscope:find-functions-calling\natom-cscope:find-text-string\natom-cscope:find-egrep-pattern\natom-cscope:find-file\natom-cscope:find-files-including\natom-cscope:find-assignments-to\n```\n\nThe following commands are registered to toggle the Widget open with \npre-selected options to save time.\n```\natom-cscope:toggle\natom-cscope:toggle-symbol\natom-cscope:toggle-global-definition\natom-cscope:toggle-functions-called-by\natom-cscope:toggle-functions-calling\natom-cscope:toggle-text-string\natom-cscope:toggle-egrep-pattern\natom-cscope:toggle-file\natom-cscope:toggle-files-including\natom-cscope:toggle-assignments-to\n```\n\nOnly `atom-cscope:toggle` has a keymap set. You can setup your own keymaps for \nthe other commands.\n\nThe command `atom-cscope:focus-next` allows you to switch between the main \neditor and the widget, while the widget is open.\n\nCommand `atom-cscope:refresh-db` allows you to create/re-create the cscope\ndatabase for all the projects in the Atom workspace.\n\nCommand `atom-cscope:project-select` allows you to open the dropdown to select\nthe project in which you want to run the cscope query in (For all those who do\nnot want to touch your mouse :P)\n\nThere are 3 ways of executing a search:\n* Live search: Executes a search with configurable delay after you input your \n   search term.\n* Enter Key: Just press enter after typing your input.\n* \"SCOPE IT!\" button: Click the button.\n\nIf new search is same as previous search, no action is taken. However, you can\nforce search by clicking on the \"SCOPE IT!\" button\n\nYou can navigate the Result Items using arrow keys and press `enter` to open \nthe target file in a new buffer and the cursor automatically moves to the \nlocation of the query or you can click on the Result Item for the same effect.\n\n## Set it up?\nYou can use the existing cscope.out file, generate on your own, or generate\nthrough the widget with the lightning button.\n\nTo generate cscope.out manually, in your project directory run:\n```bash\nfind . -name \"*.c\" -o -name \"*.cpp\" -o -name \"*.h\" -o -name \"*.hpp\" > cscope.files\ncscope -q -R -b -i cscope.files\n```\nAnd then the package will be able to use the cscope.out file to generate results.\n\n## Screenshots\n![ScreenShot](http://i.imgur.com/t7p7lvn.png)\n\n## Further Improvements?\n1. Add 'Change this text string' functionality\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/amitab/atom-cscope/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/amitab/atom-cscope#readme","_id":"atom-cscope@0.14.1","_shasum":"bf9222b62852446e270f40fe90919b2c051c4f23","_resolved":"file:../d-116514-7354-p0tc2h/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116514-7354-p0tc2h/package.tgz"}
